= What is PyScript =

PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTMLâ€™s interface. PyScript aims to give users a first-class programming language that has consistent styling rules, is more expressive, and is easier to learn.

You can find out more about PyScript at: (https://pyscript.net/)

= How do I use the PyPlugger for PyScript? =

Once activated, go to any page or post and enter Pythonic commands between the following PyScript tags as HTML content:

`<py-script> </py-script>`

For example, to print a "Hello World!" statement, you would enter the following as html content:

`<py-script> print('Hello World!') </py-script>`

An additional feature to create an REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop component can be rendered by using the following tag:

`<py-repl> </py-repl>`

Then, on the end-user page, enter data for evaluation and then press SHIFT+ENTER to compute.

= Are you or the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin associated with the official PyScript Organization? =

No, neither I nor the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin are associated with the official PyScript Organization nor any of its' parent companies, sister companies, nor subsidiaries which may include Pyodide or Anaconda Inc.

I developed the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin in adherence to the PyScript's Organization's governance policy for use of its' trademark and open-source license, which can be found on their GitHub repository at the following link: (https://github.com/pyscript/governance)

= Why did you develop the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin? =
I developed the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin out of curiosity. I love a challenge and wanted to see if it would work on one of my websites as this is the very first plugin I've ever developed for WordPress. I also wanted to make it available free of charge as I am excited about learning Python and PHP, and I would like to contribute to the software development community beyond Twitter and GitHub. As a newbie freelance software developer, I thought this would also be a great opportunity to add experience to my resume by publishing a plugin to the mostly widely used content management system in the world, one that I've used for almost a decade as a hobbyist Web Administrator and Front-End Web Developer, which is WordPress.

= Can I send you a donation? =
I thought you'd never ask, and you most certainly can! I would be honored to accept your donation to further my learning experience in Software Development. Please use the following link for your generous offer, and I humbly thank you with great joy in advance:
